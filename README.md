# mmommo

PencilMMO is a massively-multiplayer interactive art project. Take control of a pencil and colour the world. The project is currently in alpha but you can [test it live here!](http://pencilmmo.com/). PencilMMO uses HTML5 Canvas for visuals (2d & 3d w/ Three.js). The networking is done with Websockets and the game runs on a Node backend.
